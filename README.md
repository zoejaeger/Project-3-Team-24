**Geany installation instructions (for Windows 10)**
Note: for instructions with screenshots included, please refer to "Geany Installation Instructions.pdf" in the Project 3 Team 24 repository.

**Geany Setup:**

First we will set up Geany, then afterwards we will install and set up the MinGW compiler. Here are the steps for setting up Geany on your Windows 10 device:

1. Go to the Geany homepage by following this link: https://www.geany.org/

1. Navigate to the downloads page by clicking the blue “Download Geany 1.36” button on the website, or alternatively by following this link: https://www.geany.org/download/releases/ 

1. From there, double click on the Windows “geany-1.36_setup.exe” file under the “Releases” column heading and beside the “Windows” row. 
1. After you click that, a download should start. You will see it along the bottom of your Google Chrome browser if you use Chrome. 
1. Once the download is complete (when there is no “seconds remaining” on your download bar), click on the up arrow next to the download and click the option “Show in folder” - this will take you to your downloads folder on your computer. 

1. If you are using a different web browser or you cannot see it, just navigate to your downloads folder on your computer, using File Explorer and go to “This PC”, then find your “Downloads” folder. If the Geany setup download isn’t there, try repeating steps 1 to 4 in order to download the setup file again. 

1. Now that we have downloaded the Geany setup application, we need to run it in order to set up Geany on our computer. Double click on the “geany-1.36_setup.exe” file in your Downloads folder to start running the setup application.  

1. You might get a message from your computer along the lines of “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?” You should get two options: Yes, or No. Select “Yes” by clicking on the Yes button to allow the installation process to continue. 

1. Now you should get a pop-up which will say “Welcome to Geany 1.36 Setup” and will have two buttons along the bottom of the window: “Next >” and “Cancel”. 

1. Click the “Next >” button to continue the setup process.

1. Next you will have a License Agreement come up.

1. Make sure you read through and agree with all of the terms on the agreement before you select the “I Agree” button to continue the Geany installation. If you do not agree with the terms, you cannot use Geany.

1. Once you click the “I Agree” button, you should see a pop-up asing you to "Choose Components".

1. The Geany setup application will have automatically ticked the green boxes for you, which dictate what parts of Geany you will be installing. If you have none of the boxes ticked by default, manually tick the ones we want to install (by clicking the little squares), which is all of them but the last one called “Development files”. We do not need this part of the download for our project. Once the boxes are ticked, click the “Next >” button to continue. 

1. From there you will see a message that will  ask you to choose where you would like to install the Geany files on your computer.

1. By default, the Geany setup will select your C: drive on your computer inside your “Program Files” for the destination folder. I would recommend just allowing the files to be downloaded there, to the default location, it makes finding the files a lot easier later. However, if you do wish to change the destination folder, you can click the “Browse…” button on the screen and select a different folder for the Geany files. 

1. You will then see a message prompting you to “Choose Start Menu Folder”

1. It is asking you to select a folder in your Start Menu on your computer for the Geany shortcut to be placed. Again, I would recommend just going with the default option they have given us, which is creating a new folder called “Geany” (typed for you already by default) for the Geany shortcut on the Start Menu. Now click the “Install” button on the bottom right corner of the prompt to continue. 
1. Now you will see all the files install on your device.

1. During this process, you do not need to do anything, you can just sit back and watch the progress on the installation, measured by the green bar on the Geany 1.36 Setup pop-up. This part shouldn’t take too long, but if it does take longer than a minute, please just be patient. If something goes wrong or you accidentally close it, abort the process and repeat steps 5 to 18. 

1. Once the files have all been installed, you will see a message that says “Completing Geany 1.36 Setup”.

1. Leave both boxes unticked and select the “Finish” button to finalise the installation process. This will close the Geany 1.36 Setup program which signals the end of the process. Now we can double check that Geany has actually been set up properly by running it! 

1. Click the Windows logo on the very bottom left-hand corner of your computer’s screen to open the Start Menu. 

1. Now, without clicking anything else, type “geany” using your computer’s keyboard. You should immediately see a result for your search: the Geany App.

1. Double click the Geany App underneath the “Best match” heading. This will launch Geany with a blank file. You can close Geany now if you wish, by clicking the red “X” at the top right-hand side of the Geany program. Now we can move on to installing MinGW, our compiler we will use with Geany.

**MinGW install**
DO THIS AFTER YOU HAVE INSTALLED GEANY

16.	Congratulation the AVC robot is now installed. Now you need to download and install SFML library.

SFML install
ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED AND SETUP THE AVC FILES, MINGW, AND GEANY
1.	Go to the following link (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ ) and click on the button labelled download to the right of “GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (DW2) - 32-bit”. On the button it should say 15.5MB

8.	Once opened delete all the lines in there and replace it with this code:

INCLUDE = -I 
LIBS = -L 
robot.exe: robot.o 
	g++ $(LIBS) -o robot robot.o -lsfml-window  -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-system -lsfml-network 
robot.o: robot.cpp
